    "text": "Dr. Muhammad Aammar Tufail worked at University of Kiel, Germany, where he utilized the data science, machine learning and bioinformatics approaches to do the molecular and biochemical characterization of the nitrogen regulatory network and general stress response in a mesophilic methanogenic archaeal model organism Methanosarcina mazei strain Gö1, which is crucial for climate and environmental research due to its ability to produce methane. In addition, he did several key Meta-analysis and modeling studies to mediate the nitrogenous gaseous emission and improving agricultural crop productivity.\nMuhammad completed his Industrial Ph.D. in Agricultural Microbiology (2021) under Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions at the University of Trento (Italy) with his previous roles at Fondazione Edmund Mach (Italy), and e-nema GmbH (Germany), which broadened his expertise in microbial ecology to reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and sustainable use of N fertilizers for environmental sustainability. He earned his Masters degree in Agriculture-Soil Science from University of Agriculture Faisalabad, Pakistan (2016), where he focused on abiotic stress tolerance in maize plants, and Bachelor’s degree in Agriculture-Soil and Environmental Sciences from College of Agriculture, University of Sargodha, Pakistan (2013).\nFull publication list: Google Scholar\n\n\n\nNotable Experience and HonorsInternships and Part-timeSkills\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducationMiscellaneous\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Back to top"
